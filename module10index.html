<h1>Module 10:</h1>

<p>I analyzed my html markup thus far and it is almost completely separated from the CSS I’ve written to stylize the markup. I decided to write my website in a Bootstrap framework, and because I am completely new to the style, there is definitely some confusion of content and CSS. At the beginning of my page, I use custom css to style specific tags, such as the .jumbotron tag. I added a custom styling of the .jumbotron to feature one of my own photographs. Most of the inline CSS I created was done in the <head> tag. Thanks to bootstrap, each section of my html is commented, but I need to work on adding more comments so the coding is more clear, especially as I proceed in the future and will be adding more and more content to my site.  I also try to use less of the <span> tag. It seems bootstrap developers are very keen to use this and I find it very unclear and that it disguises content as code, which is not helpful to me. I am also keen to continue working towards completely separating my html from my CSS, and I am attempting to better understand how working with Bootstrap actually works. When I initially installed it for example, I could not find the  CSS file my index was referencing, and so created new CSS in my <head> tags. Well, once I found the actual CSS file, my  html was crowded by the initial “fixing” of the theme I had installed into my html. Now, it is somewhere in the middle.   On the bootstrap website, they talk about how installing bootstrap themes is as simple as replacing the CSS file. I attempted this, and my page was unrecognizable, not really adhering to any of the HTML I had coded. My goal for this site is to get them totally separated to the point where I could just install a different CSS file and have a workable site.
