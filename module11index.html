<h1> Module 11 Scrum Report </h1>
<p>

When I met with my scrum team, none of us had very much done when it came to coding our portfolio website. One thing that I noticed was that my team and I were all attempting to hand-code a CSS webpage, and almost all of our hours of work had cumulated in a very amateur-looking, stagnate website. We were all struggling to get our pages centered, our buttons to a reasonable size.  My classmates said that they liked the graphics on my page, but that my layout and the amount of content I had needed work. They also stressed the importance of color in my page, which at the time relied heavily on graphics.  It was after the SCRUM session, and the way that all of our pages turned out, that I decided to  use a bootstrap theme eventually. I continued to work with CSS and exploited my limited knowledge to the best of my abilities, and what I came up with ended up looking as stagnant and amateur as the other pages.  Bootstrap was difficult to figure out, but after a few youtube tutorials I was able to  install it on my website. I wanted to go with bootstrap because everything on the web is so polished these days and I think it will set my profile apart.  Once I overcame the obstacle of installing bootstrap, I was able to more fully utilize the things my SCRUM team and I had discussed in workshop, things like how to align our pages and what a good text-to-image ratio looked like. One thing that I realized both in my SCRUM group and my presentation feedback was that color schemes do not work on the web the same way that they do in other graphic design work. My partners had extremely cohesive color schemes that took a different approach than I did originally.  At first, my color scheme consisted of red, blue, pink, light pink, and magenta. The colors where inspired by a messed up film-photograph I took, and looked very well together when combined in a more artistic way. However, for a website, it just didnâ€™t work. Alan, one of my SCRUM team members, only used three colors, with mostly white space on his page. He used blue and orange as accent colors, and both of his colors had a similar tone, and the overall effect gave it a nice contrast.  Sarah was considering a beige based color scheme, and all of her colors had a low level of contrast.  When I saw their color schemes in a web format, I realized mine was much too random. I still went with an image-based layout, but I edited the images I was using to have a more cohesive color scheme. Overall, my scrum team was most helpful in helping me figure out what type of design I wanted my page to be. They also helped me troubleshoot a lot of coding issues. Mostly, it was just really nice to be able to discuss coding with people who were on the same level as me.
